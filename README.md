# Chocolate Factory Management System

## Overview

The Chocolate Factory Management System is a web application designed for managing factories, employees, chocolates, and purchases. It supports user authentication, factory administration, and purchase tracking. Users can register, log in, manage their profiles, and interact with the system based on their roles.
